- The energy sector is accountable for around three-quarters of the greenhouse gas emissions today.  Despite the economic downturn and slump in energy demand in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the market for renewable energy sources and electric vehicles remained resilient.  The wind and solar energy sector grew, and sales of electric vehicles reached a record-high of around 40 percent growth.  In 2021, the energy sector is witnessing an extensive recovery with rapid price rises in crude oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity.  As a result, the world is experiencing the second-highest annual increase in carbon dioxide emissions in history and putting much focus and strain on the energy markets.
- Six years ago, in 2015, nearly 200 parties came together and agreed on the threat of global climate change in Paris under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  The Paris Agreement aims to control global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to target 1.5 degrees Celsius.  This year marked another decisive year in the fight against climate change as world leaders and parties assembled at the COP26 Climate Change Conference meeting in Glasgow.  After two weeks of intense talks between climate negotiators, delegates unanimously agreed to the Glasgow Climate Pact, an extension to the Paris Agreement, on keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius in sight and accelerating climate actions by specifically targeting coal-fired power and fossil-fuel subsidies.  Alongside this, 130 countries have pledged to protect 90 percent of the world's forests and natural habitats, with a commitment to end deforestation by 2030.
- Leading up to COP26, more than 50 countries and the European Union have pledged to meet net zero emissions targets and brought new commitments to the table.  However, a report released in October 2021 by the United Nations climate change body found that the measures will not even come close to meeting the 1.5 degrees Celsius target; the UNFCCC projected that the globe was likely to see an average temperature rise of up to 2.7 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.  During COP26, a list of vague net zero commitments was proposed and pledged that will reduce the number in theory, but many analysts remain doubtful that all these pledges will come to fruition.
- The COVID-19 induced recession in 2020 resulted in little progress in climate actions and has undermined years of development efforts.  According to the International Energy Agency, the pandemic has forced countries into rising global debt levels, and governments have spent around $16 trillion on stimulus measures.  Moving forward, many countries will likely still be focusing their efforts on recovering from the long term impacts of COVID-19.  Nonetheless, there are signs of the significant potential for the ramifications of the pandemic to promote the shift to net zero and decarbonisation as a result of new behavioural patterns, which are likely to remain for several years and may become the new normal.  This includes mobility changes and shifts in transportation modes, increased remote working, and an emphasis on sustainable spending and low-carbon energy deployment.  The transportation sector is forecasted to be the key contributor to future incremental oil demand but some of the largest car manufacturers are working together to make new car sales zero emission by 2040.  These along with other fundamental demand drivers will continue to influence present and future energy demand pathways.
- Primary energy demand and consumption is continuously guided by economic activities, supply and demand fundamentals, demographic factors, technology, as well as policy and regulatory frameworks.  This section discusses the future trends of the constituents of the energy mix at the regional level for the outlook period of 2020 to 2050.

	- Primary energy demand and consumption is continuously guided by economic activities, supply and demand fundamentals, demographic factors, technology, as well as policy and regulatory frameworks.  On the one hand, the world is faced with the setback caused by COVID-19 and large fiscal deficits; on the other hand, countries are striving to meet commitments to limit global warming as part of the Paris Agreement.  Therefore, it is important to note that it is very challenging to generate an accurate forecast of the future energy demand and consists of a great deal of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, many reputable institutions and companies such as IEA, OPEC, Shell and BP have made significant efforts into developing an outlook.  Most outlook reports include an ambitious scenario, a net-zero scenario, and a "business-as-usual" scenario, with the business-as-usual scenario having the most conservative view.  This section discusses the future trends of the energy mix at the regional level for the outlook period of 2020 to 2050 under the "business-as-usual" scenario.

	- Between 2020 and 2050, the largest decline in the share of the energy mix is expected for coal, dropping from 27.2 percent in 2020 to 16.9 percent in 2045.  This will be driven by the decommissioning of coal power plants worldwide, specifically in India and China.  Natural gas is anticipated to increase its share significantly, from the third energy source to surpassing oil in 2040 and becoming the leading energy contributor in 2050.  Gas demand was relatively stable during the COVID-19 induced pandemic in 2020 due to several reasons.  Firstly, declining natural gas prices made it economically attractive to switch from coal to gas. Secondly, governments developed policies to support low carbon natural gas deployment in space heating and power generation.  The greatest growth will come from other renewables, increasing to 22 percent of the energy by 2050, from just 5.7 percent in 2020.  Nuclear energy is an attractive energy source for climate mitigation and energy security.  However,  nuclear faces a lot of resistance from the public regarding safety and pollution concerns, so although some countries are investing considerably in expanding their nuclear energy sector, others are taking their nuclear plants offline.  Therefore, the role that nuclear energy plays in the energy mix is specific to the country.

		- Energy demand is anticipated to increase at 0.9 percent annually in the forecast period due to growing population, urbanisation and economic prosperity.  As shown in Figure 3.2, the energy demand growth is almost entirely attributed to Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.  Energy demand in Asia Pacific is forecasted to increase from 253.2 exajoules in 2020 to 351 exajoules in 2050, almost half of the global energy demand.  The main drivers for this growth are developing countries worldwide, such as India, Brazil, and other developing countries in Africa and Asia.  In developed regions such as Europe and North America, energy demand is expected to flatten and even decrease in the long term as there is heavy emphasis by governments on energy efficiency and the deployment of low carbon energy technologies.  On the contrary, energy demand in developing countries is expected to expand consistently as their economies improve in the long term, causing the region's energy intensive industries to flourish.  The world population is expected to reach ten million by 2050, mostly coming from these developing countries.  As the working age population rises in combination with advancing education, labour productivity in these economies will accelerate GDP and energy demand.
